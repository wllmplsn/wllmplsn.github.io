Wiliam "Liam" Paulson is a student with a love for technology, politics, design, and making ideas real.

Recently, he's created an email server (see below) which you can use to chat with him.

He has also undergone ordination with American Marriage Ministries, a long time goal of his.

In the future, he plans to obtain a license for displaying fireworks or special effects, visit all 50 states, and become a notary public.
