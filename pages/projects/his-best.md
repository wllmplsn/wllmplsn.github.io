This page, in essence, represents who I am and who I have become over the course of the class and my high school career. I have gone from reading very rarely to intensly enjoying fiction, especially that of Stephen King and the book *House of Leaves* by Mark Z. Danielewski. I've also gotten a lot better at writing my argumentative and research papers, and have adapted a much better "clinical" tone when writing when needed.

As an example here's an excerpt from a paper I did on Swedish culture, titled "Mi Tierra/My Roots":

> Swedish traditions reflect a mix of old customs and modern culture. One of the most well-known is Midsummer, celebrated in June by dancing around the maypole, flower crowns, traditional folk dress, and meals of herring and newly harvested potatoes. St. Lucia’s Day on December 13th marks the start of the Christmas season, with girls in white robes and candle crowns leading parades. Other major holidays include Walpurgis Night (April 30th), with bonfires and singing to welcome spring, and Christmas (Jul), featuring festive decorations, the Yule goat, and a big smorgasbord feast.  

I really enjoyed learning about the country my ancestors emigrated from, and the culture that has existed there and continues to persist. This project allowed me to peer into a part of myself that I hadn't seen before, and understand certain aspects of my family that I didn't previously. Now whenever my dad says something is "a Swedish thing" then I have a better time understanding it.
