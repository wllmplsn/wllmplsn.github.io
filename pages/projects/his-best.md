This page, in essence, represents who I am and who I have become over the course of the class and my high school career. I have gone from reading very rarely to intensly enjoying fiction, especially that of Stephen King and the book *House of Leaves* by Mark Z. Danielewski. I've also gotten a lot better at writing my argumentative and research papers, and have adapted a much better "clinical" tone when writing when needed.

As an example here's an excerpt from a paper I did on Swedish culture, titled "Mi Tierra/My Roots":

> Swedish traditions reflect a mix of old customs and modern culture. One of the most well-known is Midsummer, celebrated in June by dancing around the maypole, flower crowns, traditional folk dress, and meals of herring and newly harvested potatoes. St. Lucia’s Day on December 13th marks the start of the Christmas season, with girls in white robes and candle crowns leading parades. Other major holidays include Walpurgis Night (April 30th), with bonfires and singing to welcome spring, and Christmas (Jul), featuring festive decorations, the Yule goat, and a big smorgasbord feast.

I really enjoyed learning about the country my ancestors emigrated from, and the culture that has existed there and continues to persist. This project allowed me to peer into a part of myself that I hadn't seen before, and understand certain aspects of my family that I didn't previously. Now whenever my dad says something is "a Swedish thing" then I have a better time understanding it.

In addition to research, I also did work on some argumentative pieces, for example this piece on the film *Double Jeopardy*:

> In Double Jeopardy, the main character Libby is constantly trying to obtain one goal: trying to find her son Matty. Some will say that this is not true, and that she in fact only seeks revenge against her husband Nick, but at every step of the way her actions are always focused on the search for her son. This focus is evident from her time in prison, where her frantic phone calls and physical training are all motivated by the singular purpose of being strong enough to find him upon her release. Once she is paroled, she immediately breaks its conditions (risking re-incarceration) not to find Nick for the sake of revenge, but to follow the trail she believes will lead her to Matty. Finding Nick is not the end goal, but the only means to that end. He is the gatekeeper to her son's location, and every confrontation and piece of information she uncovers is simply another step toward that primary objective.

It's always fun to watch a movie in class, and even better to analyze it for what it is and what the authors tried to make with it. This conveniently reminds me of something: my own film!

I think that this was such a unique and incredible experience, and getting to spend time with my friends creating something we all enjoy was super cool, and having the support of my classmates (not to mention you!) was awesome. I definitely grew closer to people I wasn't as familiar with before, and I hope those friendships endure into the next semester and beyond. My advice to the future classes are that you should always be on the same page as your team, and communication is key. Also, shoot all your hard scenes first!

With these reflection on our film, I must now turn to the more basic form of written words on the page. Here are some books I read last year, and what I thought of them.

- One Hundred Years of Solitude (English Translation) ★★★☆☆
- When Elephants Weep ★★★★☆
- Abundance ★★★★☆
- There is no Anti-memetics Division ★★★★★
- Never Flinch (In-progress) ★★★★☆

To close, this class was a lovely experience. Especially combined with last years class I had a blast watching movies, and reading way more, inspiring me to get invested in overcoming my fears of horror films and reading outside of school. Thank you for having me, and thank you for putting up with all of the noise and swearing. You will always hold a very special place in my heart.

With much love and admiration,
